This is a calibration project for the JWST NIRISS Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy mode.

The goal os this project is to understand the impact the pupil wheel position angle has on SOSS spectra and our ability to accurately measure the trace of a spectrum. In doing so, we can identify the trace pixel shift and/or rotation and parameterize their effects which in turn can be then be used to update the wavelength solution accordingly. As more and more SOSS observations are conducted, we can recorded long term behaviors of the the system.

When SOSS is active and using the CLEAR/GRISM700XD mode, the grism is centered as the pupil wheel rotates into position. The pupil wheel can be misaligned from a 10th to 100th which can results in a shift/rotation of the SOSS spectra on the detector.
